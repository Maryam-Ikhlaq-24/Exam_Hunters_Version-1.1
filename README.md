# 🎓 Exam Hunters

**Exam Hunters** is a text-based survival strategy game that simulates the final 3 days before a student's exam week.  
Built as part of the **Amazon Q CLI Challenge**, this game emphasizes decision-making under pressure with limited time and resources.

> *"Even under pressure, every decision can bring you closer to the person you're meant to be."*

## 🎮 Concept

You play as a student navigating the stressful lead-up to final exams.  
Every action affects your well-being, academics, and relationships.  
There’s no perfect strategy — only trade-offs. Your final outcome is based on your stats at the end of Day 3.

## 🧠 Core Message

*Exam Hunters* serves as a narrative **"empathy machine."**  
It reflects how our values emerge when time and energy are scarce — just like in real life.  
The game doesn't judge how you play; it simply shows how your **choices shape who you become**.

🎯 The goal? Survive the week and discover which version of yourself you’ve become.
